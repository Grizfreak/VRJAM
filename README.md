# VR Tower Defense game - ESIEA XR JAM Project 2024

VR Tower Defense game — a fast-paced VR experience made in 30 hours during a hackathon!

## Getting Started

### Description
This project is a VR-only game where players embody an explorer defending their expedition's treasure against waves of pirate invaders.  
Using XR hand tracking and a constraint of only **two types of interactions**, players can **form fists to punch and destroy incoming pirates** who are trying to steal their precious gold on a tropical island.  
The theme of the hackathon was **"Water"**, reflected through the tropical island surrounded by the ocean.

The project was developed using **Unity** and tested with XR headsets compatible with **OpenXR** runtime.

### Usage
- You can create water waves by raising your hands from bottom to the up
- You can fists in the air to create water projections in front of your punch

> _Note: Movement is stationary to enhance immersion and prevent motion sickness during rapid gameplay._
